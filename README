This is a Complete Virtual City which contains museums, restaurants, beaches, theatres, library, temple, hotels, and dynamic video panels and advertisements.
The video panels are clickable, in the sense that they will play and pause when they are clicked.
The directory is to be run on a server, or a localhost, as the textures and images are included. It can be nodejs, python, etc.
To nagivate through the city, there are w-a-s-d controls, and click and move the mouse to move the view of the scenery.
There are people, and decorative houses in the city.
